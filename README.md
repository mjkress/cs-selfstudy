# Self Study Plan

## Overview:
### Study Schedule: 
1-1.5 hrs every morning 6-7:30am for studying (video lectures, books, exercises - not projects)
### Side-Projects
Build these up on weekends/in the evenings when you get time 
### Challenge/Language Learning
No strict schedule; Try to find time in evenings/weekends (10-15 minutes at a time)
### Flashcards and Cheatsheets
Update and Referece requently

## Resources/Guides: 
Resource | Description
---------|------------
  [Open-Source Society Univ. (OSSU)](https://github.com/ossu/) | Aims to provide the same education as a undergraduate CS program; Fairly comprehensive but less currated; Primary Guide used; 
  [Teach Yourself CS](https://teachyourselfcs.com/) | Concise list of important books/topics; Check back here periodically
  [Coding Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university) | Interview-prep study resources/strategies; Use this a few months before applying for jobs
