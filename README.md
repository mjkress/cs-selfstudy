# Self Study Plan 
## Motivation:
This repo will serve to track my self study progress starting in July 2020. I'm currently working as a software developer in an R&D capacity at a construction technology company in Vancouver, British Columbia. While I love and am passionate about the work, since beginning this role in Winter 2019, I've encountered challenges that have revealed many areas that I could improve. Addressing these short-comings will allow me to write better code and solve bigger problems. <br><br>

While I have learned a lot as I transitioned to a developer role, I believe dedicated and focused efforts towards education outside of work will be necessary for me to feel more fulfilled. This study plan aims to build a solid foundation for a career in software engineering (Core), challenge my problem solving skills (Coding Challenges/Side Projects), expose myself to special topics in CS (e.g., Data Science/Machine Learning, Robotics, Compilers) and also to fill in gaps for topics I already have some experience with (computer graphics, computational geometry, CAD/CAM, kinematic simulation). <br><br>

I will be checking off courses as I complete them and labeling in-work courses as such, for anyone who may want to check in on my progress.

## Overview:
### Study Schedule: 
1-1.5 hrs every morning 6-7:30am for studying (video lectures, books, exercises - not projects)
### Side-Projects
Build these up on weekends/in the evenings when you get time 
### Challenge/Language Learning
No strict schedule; Try to find time in evenings/weekends (10-15 minutes at a time)
### Flashcards and Cheatsheets
Update and Referece requently

## Resources/Guides: 
This Study plan is primarily based off the 3 self-taught CS resources below. 
Resource | Description
---------|------------
  [Open-Source Society Univ. (OSSU)](https://github.com/ossu/) | Aims to provide the same education as a undergraduate CS program; Fairly comprehensive but less currated; Primary Guide used; 
  [Teach Yourself CS](https://teachyourselfcs.com/) | Concise list of important books/topics; Check back here periodically
  [Coding Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university) | Interview-prep study resources/strategies; Use this a few months before applying for jobs
